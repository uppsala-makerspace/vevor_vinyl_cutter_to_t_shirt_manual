# 6. Setup the vinyl cutter

The vinyl cutter has three parameters:

- Origin: the bottom-left of the cut,
  move the red dot to the bottom-left of the vinyl
- Speed: the speed of the blade
    - If the speed is too high, no idea what happens.
     Please [contribute](../CONTRIBUTING.md) if you know!
    - If the speed is too low, the process takes needlessly longer
- Force: how much force the blade applies to the vinyl
    - If the force is too high, the cutter will go through the vinyl
    - If the force is too low, the vinyl cannot be removed easily
