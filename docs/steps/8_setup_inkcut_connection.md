# 8. Set up Inkcut connection

Go to the 'Configure device | Connection':

- Type: Serial port
- Port: `ttyUSB0`. If you cannot select `ttyUSB0`, you've used the wrong USB cable
  coming out of the vinyl cutter :-)
- Baudrate: 38400

![Use the serial port with a baudrate of 38400](set_baudrate_to_38400.png)
