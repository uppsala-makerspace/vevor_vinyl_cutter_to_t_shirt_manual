Heat up the heat press, this takes about 15 minutes.

Place the T-shirt under the press,
with the foil at the right spot.

When the heat press is warmed up,
lower the press. After around 20 seconds,
the press will start to beep. Raise the press again.

Wait for the print to cool off.

Carefully peel off the transparent layer from the shirt.

Done!
