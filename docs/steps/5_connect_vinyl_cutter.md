# 5. Connect the vinyl cutter

Plug in the correct USB cable from the vinyl cutter to your computer:

Vinyl cutter side|Center|Computer side
-----------------|------|-------------

???- question "Why do you use this setup?"

    Because it was the first one that worked for me.

    Please [contribute](../CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to
    document the other way to connect a laptop to the vinyl cutter.
