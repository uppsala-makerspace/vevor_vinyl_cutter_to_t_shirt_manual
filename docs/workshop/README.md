## Frequently asked questions

### What colors can I choose from?

The ones we have. Currently, this is only white.

### Can I bring my own vinyl?

Yes, at your own risk.

### Do I need to bring a T-shirt?

No.

We will use a testing T-shirt to make prints.

### Can I bring and use my own T-shirt?

Yes.

### Do I need to bring a picture that I want to print?

No.

We will use a simple known-to-work image to make prints,
which is the logo of the LÃ¶rdagskurser.

### Can I bring and use my own image?

Yes.

However, if that image is not accepted by Inkcut or is too complex,
we will ask you to use the testing image instead, so that all
learners can use the vinyl cutter.

### Can I bring my own laptop?

Yes.

It can be used for:

- All: using Inkscape to create images
- Linux-only: using Inkcut to communicate with the vinyl cutter
