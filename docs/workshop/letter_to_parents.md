# Letter to parents

Dear parents/caretakers,

You can be proud on your son/daughter: he/she
volunteered in teaching a workshop on using
a vinyl cutter to make T-shirts!

Here I double-check if it is possible for you
to drop them off and pick them up :-)

Here we see our team of teachers:

Person|Task
------|-----------
Enrico|Software installation
Angela|Vinyl cutter
Leo   |Heat press

It is on:

- Date: Friday 7 February 2025
- Time: 17:00-20:00 (we prepare one hour)
- Place: Uppsala Makerspace

Would it be possible to drop off the teachers between 17:00-17:15?

If no, please let me know, `[email]`
or call/text/WhatsApp to `[phone]`.

If yes, and there is a last-minute problem on that day,
please let me know, `[email]`
or call/text/WhatsApp to `[phone]`.

Thanks so much for your help! Cheers, Richel
